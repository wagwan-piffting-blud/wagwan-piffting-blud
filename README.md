Howdy, I'm Wags. I make things on the Internet for fun, and break stuff sometimes. It's super entertaining!

Want to learn about puzzles? Check out [my website](https://wagspuzzle.space/), where I host my puzzles and training for said puzzles.

Things I've gone and worked on:

- My site (linked above)
- The Mr. Robot ARGs (season 3 fully and 4 kind of)
- Game Preservation for Mirror's Edge: Catalyst (2016), see [The Beat Revival](https://www.beatrevival.me/) for more about that
- Emergency Alert System/Specific Area Message Encoding work (including a fully [browser-based ENDEC](https://github.com/wagwan-piffting-blud/EAS-Tools), and a Discord relay bot written in Rust coming Soon:tm:
- [Coin Collection Information DataBase (CCIDB)](https://github.com/wagwan-piffting-blud/ccidb), an open-source (and closed-source cloud version available at [https://ccidb.net/](https://ccidb.net/)) coin collection management software
- ...always with more to come.

Feel free to reach out on the Contact Me page on my site if you ever need to reach me personally for any reason. I check my emails multiple times a day and am always eager to chat. Thanks!
